# grimoire

> A grimoire (also known as a “book of spells”) is a textbook of magic, typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits, deities and demons.

My personal and dogmatic grimoire of algorithms, data structures and other knowledges. Use at your own risks.
